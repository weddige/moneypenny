Moneypenny
==========

Moneypenny is a simple and extensible XMPP bot. It was intended as my personal playground and contains a mess of
half-baked ideas.

This is an condensed version of the core functionality. Although I provide this code "as is", without any support, I
accept bug reports or suggestions gladly.

Requirements
------------
.. code:: 
    git+git://github.com/weddige/pyaiml3.git#egg=PyAIML
    SQLAlchemy
    adventure
    dnspython3
    psutil
    python-seth
    sleekxmpp

Installation
------------

Make

pip install URL

and create ~/.moneypenny/config with

.. code::
    [daemon]
    pidfile=~/.moneypenny/moneypenny.pid
    [moneypenny]
    user=MONEYPENNY@SERVER.TLD
    password=PASSWORD
    admin=YOU@SERVER.TLD
    [database]
    url=sqlite:////~/.moneypenny/local.db
    [logging]
    level=INFO
    file=~/.moneypenny/moneypenny.log
    [textadventure]
    file=~/.moneypenny/sessiondata/{0}.savegame
    [conversation]
    file=~/.moneypenny/sessiondata/{0}.conversation

and finally run

moneypenny [START|STOP|RESTART]?

Have fun!
